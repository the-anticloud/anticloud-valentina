## What This Project Is

Welcome to [Valentina](https://smart-pattern.com.ua/), a versatile cross-platform patternmaking program designed for creating and modeling clothing patterns. Whether you prefer using standard sizing tables or individual measurements, this software provides a flexible environment for pattern creation. Valentina seamlessly integrates modern technologies with traditional methods to offer a comprehensive patternmaking tool.

This is the upstream project, vendored at the pinned commit above and packaged offline-first. The 12 improvements Anticloud adds live in `anticloud/` and are described under *Anticloud Overlay* below. Every fact in this file traces to a file in this directory.

## Installation

To install Valentina, please visit our website [Valentina Website] and download the version that best suits your needs. Valentina supports two branches: `stable` and `dev`. Version numbers follow a specific pattern to indicate stability and development status:

- **Stable Version:**
  - Version numbers with even digits (e.g., 1.0) are reserved for stable releases.
  - Stable versions receive bug fixes to ensure a reliable and stable user experience.

- **Edge Version:**
  - Version numbers with odd digits (e.g., 1.1) represent the development branch.
  - The dev version is actively developed and receives bug fixes and new features, providing a more feature-rich experience.
  - While stable versions are suitable for initial checks, we recommend the dev branch for professional use due to its more advanced functionality.

Select the platform you use, and then choose the version most appropriate for your operating system. Versions marked with a "+" symbol indicate compatibility with the specified version of the OS and higher.

We recommend using the `dev` branch for professional use to take advantage of the latest features and improvements. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the **Support** section for assistance.

## Usage

See the upstream README (linked above) for usage. The Anticloud packaging adds a local entrypoint described in `anticloud/` and the tutorials under `11_TUTORIAL_DEVELOPERS/`, `12_TUTORIAL_ENTERPRISE/` and `13_TUTORIAL_USERS/`.

## Anticloud Overlay

The 12 improvements live under `anticloud/`. Run the check suite from this directory:

```
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

Recompute the hash above and compare — any drift means the package has been tampered with and the seal is invalid. This is a self-assessment; no external audit has been performed and a SOC 2 / NIST independent audit is committed post-funding.
